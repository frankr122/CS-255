Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  DriverPass aimed to help students better prepare for their driving tests in an attempt to increase driving test pass percentages. The client, DriverPass wanted to create a web based service that provided online resources and a webspace to access lesson plans and schedule mock exams. The system they wanted me to design was a way for students to have ease of access to material, and a space where instructors can guide and assist these students in their virtual studies.

What did you do particularly well?

  I believe I was able to gather the main needs required for DriverPass. Mainly refering to the type of program required, what they needed in their program and the main goal that needed to be accomplished.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I had to choose a part to improve, I would choose to improve the amount of detail included. Some points I often overlook and don't include, leading to insufficient detail that would otherwise be required. To improve it, I would add greater detail to almost every aspect.

  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  When interpreting the users needs and implementation, I first analyzed and decided what the user was most looking for in their program. I made sure every feature supported whatever the user was needing. Need consideration is important since the design should align with what works well with the user. A system should solve a users needs and eliminate any problem to make a smoother experience.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  With my approach to designing software, I first break down the main requirements of what the system needs to do. After that I piece together how everything will connect within the software. In the future, I would try to focus more on the fine details. Ensuring every stone is overturned leads to a smooth program that has less bugs and less errors that a user may run into.
